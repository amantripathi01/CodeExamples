   ########## Test-Scenarios ##########  

Scenario 1: Test for positive initial capacity and load factor less than 1

Details:
  TestName: TestPositiveInitialCapacityAndLoadFactorLessThanOne
  Description: This test will verify if the method CalculateCapacity can correctly calculate the capacity and limit capacity for a positive initial capacity and a load factor less than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a positive initial capacity and a load factor less than 1.
  Act: Call the CalculateCapacity method with the created initial capacity and load factor.
  Assert: The returned capacity and limit capacity should be correct.
Validation:
  The assertion will verify if the calculated capacity and limit capacity are correct. The expected result is derived based on the algorithm used in the CalculateCapacity method. This test is significant as it covers the scenario where the initial capacity is positive and the load factor is less than 1, which is a common scenario in hash map operations.

Scenario 2: Test for zero initial capacity

Details:
  TestName: TestZeroInitialCapacity
  Description: This test will verify if the method CalculateCapacity can correctly calculate the capacity and limit capacity for a zero initial capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a zero initial capacity and a load factor.
  Act: Call the CalculateCapacity method with the created initial capacity and load factor.
  Assert: The returned capacity and limit capacity should be correct.
Validation:
  The assertion will verify if the calculated capacity and limit capacity are correct. The expected result is derived based on the algorithm used in the CalculateCapacity method. This test is significant as it covers the edge case where the initial capacity is zero.

Scenario 3: Test for negative initial capacity

Details:
  TestName: TestNegativeInitialCapacity
  Description: This test will verify if the method CalculateCapacity can handle negative initial capacity.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a negative initial capacity and a load factor.
  Act: Call the CalculateCapacity method with the created initial capacity and load factor.
  Assert: An appropriate exception should be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion will verify if the correct exception is thrown. This test is significant as it covers the edge case where the initial capacity is negative, which should not be allowed in hash map operations.

Scenario 4: Test for load factor greater than 1

Details:
  TestName: TestLoadFactorGreaterThanOne
  Description: This test will verify if the method CalculateCapacity can handle a load factor greater than 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an initial capacity and a load factor greater than 1.
  Act: Call the CalculateCapacity method with the created initial capacity and load factor.
  Assert: An appropriate exception should be thrown.
Validation:
  The assertion will verify if the correct exception is thrown. This test is significant as it covers the edge case where the load factor is greater than 1, which should not be allowed in hash map operations.
